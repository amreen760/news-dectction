# news-dectction
The news detection Python code is designed to automatically classify a given text (like a social media post, article snippet, or headline) as either news or non-news. Depending on the context, it may also distinguish between real news and fake news. This is often used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML)
